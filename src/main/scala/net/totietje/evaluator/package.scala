/** The `evaluator` package is designed to simplify the process of parsing a string.
  *
  * The work of parsing a string is reduced to just tokenizing an expression, that is, breaking it down into its
  * principal parts. The `Evaluator` class will handle the rest.
  *
  * The `AbstractEvaluator` makes this even easier, though it is only applicable in some situations.
  *
